# NIDS-with-Explainable-AI
This project aims to develop an intelligent and interpretable Network Intrusion Detection System using deep learning and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. It leverages a neural network to classify various network attacks with high accuracy, while integrating SHAP and LIME to provide transparency in model predictions.
